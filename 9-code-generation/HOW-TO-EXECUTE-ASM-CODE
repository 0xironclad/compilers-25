Run the default compiler like this:

	./compile_and_run.sh ex/default/tests/01.ok

To solve an exercise, change the appropriate parts under ex/<the exercise>, then run it like this.

	./compile_and_run.sh ex/01-incdec/tests/01.ok

The script will detect which exercise you're using.

Notes.
- You'll see some "Extending rule" warnings. You may ignore them if no other warnings are showing.
- Sometimes, you'll have to add simple semantic content into some files under src/ as well.
- The new syntax rules that are added to the grammar are always listed in the while.y.post file.
  However, you may need to add some semantic rules to some old rules.
  - You have to find which ones you have to modify and how.
  - Comment out the old rule so that it doesn't interfere.
- In some cases, the compiler won't even compile until you add/modify the necessary parts.

---------------------------------------------------------------

The same can be achieved like this, too:

	make EX=ex/01-incdec
	./compiler/while example.while > example.asm
	nasm -felf example.asm
	gcc io.c example.o -m32 -no-pie -o code/example
	./example

Note: we are using 32 bit code.
If you are running it on your own system, which probably is a 64 bit one, you may have to install some 32 bit C libraries.

	sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386
	sudo apt update
	sudo apt install libc6-dev-i386 gcc-multilib
